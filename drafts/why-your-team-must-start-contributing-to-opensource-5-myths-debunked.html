<p>7 reasons why your team must start contributing to opensource right now
How to perfect your team&#8217;s skills by contributing to opensource: 7 tips
7 tips to perfect your team&#8217;s skills by contributing to&nbsp;opensource</p>
<hr />
<p>Recently i got an email from some software company <span class="caps">CEO</span>. He was looking for a
mentor: a skilled expert who could help boosting developers&#8217; skills. You know,
code review, design tips, all that&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>But how much he was suprised when I told him that he&#8217;d rather consider
encouraging his devs to contribute to opensource projects. He apparently treated
it as a completely unrelated thing. That, in turn, suprised me quite a bit, so
today I&#8217;d like to elaborate a bit more on this&nbsp;topic.</p>
<p>Well, how much does <em>that</em> actually help to perfect coding and design skills?
From my standpoint, it&#8217;s invaluable to virtually every proficiency level. See
for&nbsp;yourself:</p>
<h3 id="interns-and-newcomers">Interns and&nbsp;newcomers</h3>
<p>Two problems we all face when dealing with newbies: a) not to break things
that already work, and b) determine if he talented enough to suit us as a regular&nbsp;worker.</p>
<p>And what do we do usually? &#8220;Go read our codebase&#8221;, &#8220;go fix some docs&#8221;. Do you
really think writing docs is much more easier than coding? I&#8217;m sorry, but
you&#8217;re wrong. And sometimes it even results in giving the intern the paperwork
or making him or her just reading the books &#8220;just so he learns before doing
something&#8221;. Oh gosh,&nbsp;no.</p>
<p>Anyways. I bet you&#8217;re using some opensource libraries and tools for your
project. Likely a handful of them. And there are certainly some stupid,
easy-fixable bugs in them that bother you all the time. So just ask your intern
to fix one. And this task will test the whole spectrum of the successful
developer&#8217;s&nbsp;habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refine an actual&nbsp;problem</li>
<li>Find an acceptable&nbsp;solution</li>
<li>Code the&nbsp;fix</li>
<li>Communicate with the tool or library core devs to get things&nbsp;merged</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span class="caps">HINT</span></em>: In case you&#8217;re a newbie yourself, you might have already guessed: the best
experience you can show off to your employer are your contributions to some
public&nbsp;repos.</p>
<h3 id="junior-and-middle-devs">Junior and Middle&nbsp;devs</h3>
<p>Every (well, almost) junior coder wants to become a senior one. But what&#8217;s the major difference between&nbsp;them?</p>
<p>vary work so it doesn&#8217;t bore
always pushing beyond the limits
not to stop, not to freeze
best&nbsp;practices</p>
<p>work on opensourcing your own&nbsp;libs</p>
<h3 id="seniors">Seniors</h3>
<p>dry
workflow
triaging issues
design&nbsp;Deprecation</p>
<p>applicable not only to libraries, where the developers are main users, but to
<span class="caps">REST</span> APIs as well (which seem to become a must-have for almost every web&nbsp;project).</p>
<p>Some of projects have much larger userbase, than your&nbsp;project.</p>
<h3 id="team-leads-and-ctos">Team leads and&nbsp;CTOs</h3>
<p>where to find good devs?
    who to hire?
hiring heaven: candidates you&#8217;re 100% confident in, just because they
already wrote some code for <em>your project</em>, not some sample&nbsp;one.</p>
<h3 id="the-myths">The&nbsp;myths</h3>
<p>There is a bunch of myths around the opensource. I&#8217;ll concern a&nbsp;few:</p>
<h4 id="its-for-students-only">it&#8217;s for students&nbsp;only</h4>
<h4 id="there-are-only-bugs-they-wont-accept-my-new-feature-">there are only bugs, they won&#8217;t accept my new feature&nbsp;-</h4>
<h4 id="nobody-needs-our-in-house-lib-promote-your-opensource-projects-and-work-itself">nobody needs our in-house lib: promote your opensource projects (and work&nbsp;itself)</h4>
<p>so hard to start: choose the right&nbsp;project</p>
<hr />
<p>github made it extremely easy <span class="caps">ACTION</span>: Go fork
so make yourself a christmas gift you&#8217;ll never regret. Start. Contributing. To.&nbsp;Opensource.</p>
