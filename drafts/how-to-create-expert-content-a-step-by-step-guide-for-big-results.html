<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

<p>Your company is full of experts. Smart, knowledgeable people who push your
business&nbsp;forward.</p>
<p>But I have a hunch they don&#8217;t participate much in content marketing. They give
a thousand reasons, from &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to write about&#8221;, to &#8220;I&#8217;m not a&nbsp;writer&#8221;.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re totally&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to build a coherent expert content strategy that involves
existing employees and doesn&#8217;t frustrate&nbsp;them.</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

<p>As with every good object, a strategy needs three footholds to be stable. For
expert content we create in our company, these three pillars&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand-based&nbsp;content</li>
<li>Separation of responsibilities within a creation&nbsp;process</li>
<li>Inherent multi-channel&nbsp;fit</li>
</ul>
<p>In this guide, I&#8217;ll show you, step by step, how to align your content to
demand, engage your colleagues in content creation, and save big by employing
multi-channel&nbsp;fit.</p>
<h2 id="first-pillar-demand-based-content">First pillar: Demand-based&nbsp;content</h2>
<p>This one is simple yet overlooked by many. First, research the subject area,
come up with a list of topics, and only then hand them over to your experts.
A common mistake here is to ask your experts to think up topics for articles.
That leads to aligning to what we have to offer but not customer&nbsp;demand.</p>
<p>Another common problem is <em>prioritizing between different topics</em>. Keyword
research will provide you with demand volume. Use it to base your strategy on
data, not on&nbsp;guesswork.</p>
<p>Finally, analyzing demand in search engines may give you <em>new invaluable
customer intents</em> you haven&#8217;t thought of&nbsp;before.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-choose-topics-for-content">How to choose topics for&nbsp;content</h3>
<p>There are dozens of various keyword research instruments. Today I&#8217;d like to
show you our workflow. We do that in a semi-automatic mode using pretty simple
free&nbsp;tools.</p>
<h4 id="collect-an-initial-keyword-corpus">Collect an initial keyword&nbsp;corpus</h4>
<p>First, come up with 3 to 10 seed keywords that you think customers may use.
Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re going to create a string of expert articles on <strong>Mexico vacations</strong>.
That gives us the following seed&nbsp;keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>tours to&nbsp;mexico</li>
<li>vacation in&nbsp;mexico</li>
<li>mexico&nbsp;hotels</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter them into <a href="https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home">Google Keyword Planner</a> under the &#8220;Search for new keywords&#8221;
section. Don&#8217;t forget to choose geographical locations where you clients may&nbsp;reside.</p>
<p><img alt="Keyword Planner seed keywords" src="../images/expert-content-strategy/expert-content-keywords-planner-1.png" /></p>
<p>Check the Keyword ideas that Google offers you. The majority of them should be
related to your initial&nbsp;keywords.</p>
<p>If you see that keywords related to your seed ones make only a fraction of a
total number, refine your search by specifying required words in the &#8220;Keywords
to include&#8221; option, or by including the words irrelevant to your business in
the &#8220;Negative keywords&#8221;&nbsp;option.</p>
<p><img alt="Keyword Planner negative keywords" src="../images/expert-content-strategy/expert-content-keyword-planner-negative-keywords.png" /></p>
<p>In our experience, this approach works much better than just turning on the
&#8220;Only show ideas closely related to my search terms&#8221;&nbsp;switch.</p>
<p>What if your keyword research hasn&#8217;t brought in much result? Turn to your
customer-facing department. They interact with clients every day and sure know
what terms and questions are most popular. Then take those insights and repeat
the whole keyword research process to get some solid data you can base&nbsp;upon.</p>
<p>Download those keywords in the &#8216;Excel <span class="caps">CSV</span>&#8217; format. Now, we need to quickly
leave out irrelevant terms. You can do that either by manually checking each
line, or by employing a clustering&nbsp;tool.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-keyword-clustering">What is keyword&nbsp;clustering</h5>
<p>Simply put, keyword clustering allows you to group phrases by meaning. Such
tool can reduce the amount of manual work&nbsp;drastically.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say we have around 30 keywords about Dominicana hotels
scattered across our &#8220;Mexican&#8221; corpus. We either would have to manually find
and delete them or just pass the list through a clustering tool. It would make
a separate group with those words, so we would be able to easily get rid of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>There are several free and paid tools in the market. In my view, a good instrument
should have the following&nbsp;features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have lemmatization or stemming. It should know that &#8216;hotel&#8217; and &#8216;hotels&#8217; are the same&nbsp;words.</li>
<li>Consider term frequency. We don&#8217;t want the tool to make groups based on frequent words, like&nbsp;&#8216;hotel&#8217;.</li>
<li>Be configurable. You should be able to add stopwords to ignore while clustering and tune other&nbsp;options.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="free-clustering-tool">Free clustering&nbsp;tool</h5>
<p>As I didn&#8217;t find the right tool for me, I put together a <a href="https://repl.it/MweG">simple Python script</a>.
It&#8217;s available online so you can play with it by pasting your keywords. We use
it on a daily basis, and so far it proved&nbsp;handy.</p>
<p>Back to our story. Here&#8217;s an example of how the clustered groups may look like for our subject&nbsp;matter:</p>
<p><img alt="Clustered Keyword Planner keywords" src="../images/expert-content-strategy/expert-content-clustered-initial-groups.png" /></p>
<p>Now that you have a list of groups, remove the irrelevant ones mercilessly.
I&#8217;ve highlighted an example of an irrelevant cluster in red. Overcome the
temptation to leave them &#8220;just in case&#8221;. The more targeted semantic core you&#8217;ll
have, the better content you&#8217;ll be able to produce. At this stage, you should
end up with 50 to 400&nbsp;keywords.</p>
<h4 id="extend-the-corpus-with-additional-suggestions">Extend the corpus with additional&nbsp;suggestions</h4>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to collect the terms that Google didn&#8217;t initially show in its
suggestions. I&#8217;m talking about the &#8220;related searches&#8221; block at the bottom of
each search results page. In fact, these &#8220;long-tail&#8221; searches are comprised of
Google&#8217;s autocomplete suggestions and other semantically related&nbsp;terms.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2017/09/seo-research-tools-content/">variety of tools</a> to collect these suggestions. We use a WhiteHat
Web scraper. It&#8217;s a homegrown application written in Python, which basically
controls a browser. It&#8217;s capable of automatically collecting data from web pages
while allowing you manually interact with websites, like entering captchas and
logging in. We&#8217;re planning on open sourcing this component&nbsp;shortly.</p>
<p>Whichever tool you prefer, feed your keywords into it to collect related
phrases. At this stage, you should have 500 to 2000&nbsp;keywords.</p>
<p>Most likely, you&#8217;ll have a lot of duplicates on your list. Before passing them
down the pipeline, remove duplicates. We use a free online tool on
<a href="https://www.online-utility.org/text/sort.jsp">online-utility.org</a>. Paste your text there and check the &#8220;Remove
Duplicates&#8221;&nbsp;box.</p>
<h4 id="clusterize-keywords-and-group-them-into-topics">Clusterize keywords and group them into&nbsp;topics</h4>
<p>Using the tool we had discussed in the step on clustering, group the pile of
keywords by meaning. As a rule, you&#8217;ll end up having 10 to 30 keywords groups.
Run through them one more time and combine the groups you believe are very
similar in&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>So how do we now distribute the resulting groups into separate pieces of
content for the most effect? Consider one of the following&nbsp;strategies:</p>
<h5 id="group-by-desired-content-length">Group by desired content&nbsp;length</h5>
<p>If you already have established copywriting guidelines, try and estimate what
length would it require to cover each group in detail. Then add up groups until
your reach your article length limit.&nbsp;Repeat.</p>
<h5 id="group-by-competition-level">Group by competition&nbsp;level</h5>
<p>Check the total keyword frequency and level of competition using Google Keywords Planner.
To do that, paste each group&#8217;s term into <a href="https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home">Google Keyword Planner</a> and take a
look at &#8216;Avg. monthly searches&#8217; and &#8216;Competition&#8217; columns. The two are a
reliable sign of how hard would it be for you to show up on the first page of
Google&nbsp;results.</p>
<p><img alt="Competition on a keyword cluster" src="../images/expert-content-strategy/expert-content-keyword-competition.png" /></p>
<p>You might then want to combine your groups in a way that you don&#8217;t have many
highly-competitive clusters in one&nbsp;article.</p>
<p>We prefer this method, mostly because we&#8217;re organic traffic oriented. As Rand
Fishkin <a href="https://moz.com/blog/targeting-multiple-keywords-vs-singular-keyword-focus">wrote back in 2010</a> (not much has changed since then), you definitely
don&#8217;t want to lump competitive keywords together on one&nbsp;page.</p>
<h5 id="group-by-personasintentposition-in-sales-funnel">Group by personas/intent/position in sales&nbsp;funnel</h5>
<p>Usually, keywords group are very different in terms of a customer intent. Some
represent a ready-to-buy client, whereas the others are simply initial research.
Targeting a single customer group within each piece content is a good idea, so
take the marketing personas (you have some, don&#8217;t you?) and group the
keyword clusters to fit different stages of the decision to buy from&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>What do we do now with all the topics we have? How do we involve our experts?
I&#8217;ll explain this in detail in the second part of this&nbsp;series.</p>
