<p>Reading personal growth and leadership books is always rewarding. Forgetting
ideas soon without integrating them into your life - not so much. Read on to
learn how to finally make books work for you with a simple 5-minute daily&nbsp;routine.</p>


<p>Throughout the last decade, I read several dozens of books on personal growth,
relationships, business, psychology, and leadership. But there&#8217;s a bit of a
problem with all that reading. I hardly could remember the titles, let alone
integrate all the worthwhile ideas into my&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>This discrepancy led me to believe I had been doing it all wrong. Or, worse
still, that I was just incapable of following strategies outlined in books. My
frustration grew on and on until I came up with a simple yet effective reading
strategy. After a few months of usage, I&#8217;m so excited with the results that I
think I must share the technique with&nbsp;you.</p>
<h2 id="why-personal-growth-books-dont-work-for-you">Why personal growth books don&#8217;t work for&nbsp;you</h2>
<p>To understand a reason why it&#8217;s so hard to put self-development books into
action, think back to the school years. What were the two key components of
learning?  First, you had not only to listen to a teacher but to write down the
concept. Next, you were given dozens if not hundreds of repetitions to make a
new idea your second nature. These two principles - reflection and repetition,
are cornerstones of any learning&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>In his book, &#8220;Visioneering,&#8221; Andy Stanley says you have to discuss the vision of
the company twenty-one times before people start to hear it. I believe the
same method applies to fully comprehending a new&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p><img alt="Forgetting curve" src="./images/ideas-depot/forgetting-curve-stahl.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>(We forget almost everything in just a day. Via&nbsp;https://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition)</em></p>
<p>No wonder that even the brightest ideas end up buried under an enormous stream
of daily&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>What about those of us who keep notebooks full of inspirational quotes? More
often than not, this treasure trove of advice ends up in a chest of drawers,
attracting dust instead of your&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
<p>In other words, not only should you take notes, but you need to set up a
hassle-free routine to regularly review notes taken. Only by re-reading a
profound idea many times you&#8217;d be able to incorporate it finally in your&nbsp;lifestyle.</p>
<p>So how can we harness technology to make those quotes keep
coming up, reaching the right time and the right mindset? Read&nbsp;on!</p>
<h2 id="solution-the-ideas-depot-reading-strategy">Solution - the &#8220;Ideas Depot&#8221; reading&nbsp;strategy</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the strategy I&nbsp;employ:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read or listen to a&nbsp;book</li>
<li>Having read a few chapters, skim them again and take&nbsp;notes</li>
<li>Review quotes on a daily&nbsp;basis</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty simple, isn&#8217;t it? The devil is in the details. Or rather, in&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p><strong>For one</strong>, make electronic notes. This is a crucial step in taking notes better.
Such a system will enable you to scale as you read more and more. Plus, it&#8217;s
much faster to copy-paste a quote if you&#8217;ve got a <span class="caps">PDF</span> version of the&nbsp;book.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">flash cards</a> instead of a regular text file. In a nutshell,
they&#8217;re cards which have two sides. On the front side, I write a book title, an
author and a title of a chapter. On the back side, there&#8217;s a quote or a few
I&#8217;d like to align my life with. Apparently, once you have your Ideas Depot
organized into separate cards, it becomes much easier to manage and review&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, the growing number of cards would have made it impossible to study them
without spending too much time. To cope with that, use a fantastic flash card
application called <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>. It offers a so-called Spaced Repetition System,
praised by many as a revolution in learning. Each time you review an idea, it
gets scheduled at a more and more distant time, freeing up space for new cards
and allowing you only to review what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">you&#8217;re about to forget</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Spaced repetition curve" src="./images/ideas-depot/ebbinghaus-diagram.png" /></p>
<p><em>(Spaced repetition makes things stick in your mind. Via http://www.wranx.com/learning/&nbsp;)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, don&#8217;t choose a specific note to review. Let Anki handle that for you,
mixing new quotes with those you could have forgotten. This point is essential
because focusing on favorite ideas at the expense of others would radically
decrease the efficiency of the&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, do reviews at the right time and on the right device. It&#8217;s not very
productive to use personal growth quotes for bedtime reading because you
simply won&#8217;t have time to comprehend them fully and try to put them into
action. It&#8217;s like books&#8217; authors turning into personal development coaches and
having a morning coffee with you, enlightening you with ideas.  Therefore, I do
two quick, 2-minute sessions for the breakfast and lunch. And, of course, I use
my smartphone, not a <span class="caps">PC</span> or a laptop. That way, even if I missed my morning
review, I&#8217;d always be able to catch up on the&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Ready to try this system out? Luckily, it&#8217;s quite easy to set up. Let me
guide you through the whole&nbsp;process.</p>
<h2 id="install-and-set-up-anki-flash-card-application">Install and set up Anki flash card&nbsp;application</h2>
<p>Start with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download">downloading a version</a> of Anki for your <span class="caps">PC</span> or laptop. I&#8217;ll be
using Windows 10 as an operating system, but the Mac experience is very
similar. After the first launch the application looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="Anki start screen" src="./images/ideas-depot/anki-start-screen.png" /></p>
<p>Here we have a single, empty pack of cards called <em>Default deck</em>. It works fine
for simple cards, for example, for learning foreign words, but isn&#8217;t well
suited for our purpose. Let&#8217;s create a separate deck for our Ideas&nbsp;Depot.</p>
<p>Next, download <a href="./images/ideas-depot/ideas-depot.apkg">this pre-configured template</a> and import it by clicking on
&#8220;Import File&#8221; at the bottom of the Anki window. Alternatively, you can import
the file by just double-clicking on it once you&#8217;ve downloaded&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, let&#8217;s add some ideas to the&nbsp;database!</p>
<h2 id="input-ideas-on-the-pc">Input ideas on the <span class="caps">PC</span></h2>
<p>To add quotes to your Ideas Depot, first, click on the &#8220;Add&#8221; link in the main Anki&nbsp;window.</p>
<p><img alt="Add note link" src="./images/ideas-depot/anki-add-note-link.png" /></p>
<p>In the next window, select &#8220;Book notes&#8221; in &#8220;Type&#8221; list, and choose &#8220;Ideas
Depot&#8221; as a &#8220;Deck&#8221;.  Now, fill the fields to your taste and hit &#8220;Add&#8221;. Note
that while you&#8217;re adding more notes, the &#8220;Book&#8221; and &#8220;Author&#8221; fields remain
prefilled. That&#8217;s a convenient feature, allowing you to focus on quotes and not
punching in the title every single&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><img alt="Add note dialog" src="./images/ideas-depot/anki-add-note-dialog.png" /></p>
<h2 id="review-ideas-on-your-smartphone">Review ideas on your&nbsp;smartphone</h2>
<p>To synchronize the ideas between your computer and smartphone, create a free
AnkiWeb account. It&#8217;s like a cloud storage for your decks. <a href="https://ankiweb.net/account/register">Sign up for an account</a>
first, then enter your email and password in the Synchronization&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p><img alt="Sync" src="./images/ideas-depot/anki-sync-dialog.png" /></p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re doing the first sync, it&#8217;ll ask you whether you want to upload
or download your decks. Choose &#8220;Upload to&nbsp;AnkiWeb&#8221;.</p>
<p><img alt="Sync confirmation" src="./images/ideas-depot/anki-sync-confirmation.png" /></p>
<p>Now install an app on your smartphone: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki">free version for Android</a> or a
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11lJ6Y">paid app for iOS</a>. The latter is pricey, but the developers say it&#8217;s the way to
keep the <span class="caps">PC</span> and web versions free. If you don&#8217;t want to shell out money for it,
you can use a <a href="https://ankiweb.net/decks/">web-based application</a> as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Hit a &#8220;Synchronize&#8221; button in the installed app and enter you AnkiWeb
credentials. You should be seeing your notes now. Review them every day,
tapping the green button to mark cards as&nbsp;seen.</p>
<p><img alt="Smartphone review look" src="./images/ideas-depot/anki-smartphone-review.png" /></p>
<p>Congratulations, you just got one step closer to putting all those brilliant
ideas into&nbsp;action!</p>
<h2 id="make-it-a-habit">Make it a&nbsp;habit</h2>
<p>Now comes the hard part. You should stick with the process to transform a fad into a useful habit.
Here are some self-development tips from my&nbsp;experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just do that. As the screenshot above tells us, 80% of success in life is just showing up. So don&#8217;t miss a single&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>Choose time wisely. Breakfast and lunch work for me, but you may, for example, do reviews while commuting or aloud at the weekly meeting&nbsp;(kidding).</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t cram. Two review sessions a day are much better than one just because they leave you more room to contemplate the&nbsp;ideas.</li>
<li>Make notes for every book you&#8217;re reading. Remember, without having copied ideas you&#8217;re very likely to forget almost&nbsp;everything.</li>
<li>Add ideas as you read. Once you&#8217;ve read or listened to a chapter, make notes. Don&#8217;t wait while the entire book is&nbsp;finished.</li>
<li>Keep notes bite-sized and comprehendible. Break down cards if they&#8217;re too big to be read in a&nbsp;minute.</li>
<li>Regard it as a self-made personal development course. Every time you review an idea, think of ways to translate it into action right&nbsp;now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s to unstoppable personal&nbsp;growth!</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas or your very own methods of translating books into action? Please share in&nbsp;comments!</p>
