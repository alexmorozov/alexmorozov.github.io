<p>Sometimes, teams feel that agile user stories are not worth the extra work. I
think I know the reason&nbsp;why.</p>

<p>Today, I wanted to share the five biggest mistakes teams make when adopting
user stories. Let’s recap what a user story is. It is a requirement expressed
in user&#8217;s terms, and it usually has three&nbsp;parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As some&nbsp;role,</p>
<p>I want to be able to do&nbsp;something,</p>
<p>So that I can achieve some&nbsp;goal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept is brilliant. I would say it&#8217;s the best thing that has happened to
requirements management in the last few decades. However,  user stories are so
deceptively simple that it&#8217;s easy to get them wrong and ruin all the value. So
here&#8217;s my top-5 of common mistakes teams&nbsp;make.</p>
<h2 id="user-stories-developer-stories">User stories != developer&nbsp;stories</h2>
<p>I am a firm believer that technical tasks and user stories don’t translate into
each other. And they should&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>What is the difference? A user story is something a customer wants to achieve,
whereas technical tasks are the little things that need to be done before the
customer can achieve his or her goal. In other words, you should not convert
every request in the backlog into user stories. Instead, have a larger user
story that encompasses several technical&nbsp;tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a first-time&nbsp;buyer,</p>
<p>I can visit the &#8220;About us&#8221;&nbsp;page</p>
<p>So that I can learn more about the&nbsp;company</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above is a typical example of a technical task wrapped with a user story. The
reason those &#8220;stories&#8221; are so widespread is that they align well with the
Behaviour-Driven Development paradigm.  Still, it&#8217;s a technical task, not a
user story. Why? Let&#8217;s take a look at what the proper user story may look&nbsp;like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a first-time&nbsp;buyer,</p>
<p>I want to check if the company is&nbsp;credible</p>
<p>so that I can be sure I won&#8217;t be&nbsp;fooled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the difference? We don&#8217;t describe (or prescribe) implementation details,
but instead, focus on what the user wants to achieve. This story is not
actionable enough and needs to be split into multiple technical tasks. But most
importantly, it acts as a guiding light, a clear test if we are moving in the
right&nbsp;direction.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-user">There is no&nbsp;“User&#8221;</h2>
<p>It is easy to explain this mistake using an&nbsp;example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a&nbsp;user,</p>
<p>I want a “Contact us”&nbsp;page</p>
<p>So that I can get in touch with company&nbsp;representatives</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with this story? Well, there are several things we could improve,
but the main problem is that we have an abstract &#8220;user&#8221; here. The thing is,
there is no just &#8220;user&#8221; or &#8220;customer&#8221; that uses your product. In fact, there
are multiple segments, groups, personas - whatever you call it - with different
goals, skill level, and&nbsp;preferences.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make much sense to tailor the product for abstract people because
you never know if you have succeeded. It&#8217;s much better to have a few personas
defined and craft user stories so that they solve the problems of these
personas. The best thing is, when you have a particular user segment to target,
you start thinking of the requirements from a different perspective, through
the eyes of a specific&nbsp;role.</p>
<p>In our example, we can choose to target first-time buyers, and when we think of
it that way, we realize the first-time buyers don&#8217;t probably need a generic
&#8220;Contact Us&#8221; page. They might want, say, an online chat to help them check out.
So a better version of the story would&nbsp;be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a first-time&nbsp;user,</p>
<p>I want someone to help with my&nbsp;order</p>
<p>So that I can check out&nbsp;online</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="customer-doesnt-need-you">Customer doesn’t need&nbsp;you</h2>
<p>Does that sound too strong? Yet, it is true. User stories should focus on
customer&#8217;s goals and expected outcomes, not on details of the technical
implementation. Sometimes, (okay, almost all the time), we forget that the
customer doesn&#8217;t need our website, system, or mobile app. What they do need is
a means of achieving their goal. Remember the saying that the customer doesn&#8217;t
buy a drill in a hardware store? They buy a hole in the&nbsp;wall.</p>
<p>Here is a good illustration of thinking too much of us instead of the&nbsp;customer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a returning&nbsp;user</p>
<p>I want to log&nbsp;in</p>
<p>So that I can store a list of my&nbsp;searches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest: the customer doesn&#8217;t want to log in at all. More than that,
they may not want to store the list of searches in and of itself. What they
want may be, for instance,&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a returning&nbsp;user</p>
<p>I want to access my searches&nbsp;quickly</p>
<p>So that I don’t have to re-type&nbsp;them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second iteration of the story is not ideal, but much better. We now focus
on the customer&#8217;s goal - save time not retyping the searches. Also, that may
lead to a technical implementation 180 degrees opposite from the initial login&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-part-is-the-most-important-one">The last part is the most important&nbsp;one</h2>
<p>It is a pervasive issue, especially if the team does not have all the people
required to deliver value. When we create a story, we might focus too much on
the first two parts - the role and description of the functionality required.
So when it comes to the third part - why I need that - we are tempted to go
&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s just put something in there. We already have perfect two parts&#8221;.
The result may look like&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a regular&nbsp;buyer</p>
<p>I want to have a list of recent&nbsp;orders</p>
<p>So that I can view&nbsp;them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the main problem with this story? It doesn’t explain to us why the
customer wants the feature. Also, as you can imagine, it may well lead to the
functionality that doesn’t satisfy the user’s need, albeit fully conforming to
the&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>How to fix that? Let’s modify it so that it contains a user-oriented goal. Like&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a regular&nbsp;buyer</p>
<p>I want to have a list of recent&nbsp;orders</p>
<p>So that I can flag an issue with an&nbsp;order</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we know why the user wants the feature, so even if our technical
implementation changes, we can quickly check if we are doing the right&nbsp;thing!</p>
<h2 id="when-are-you-done">When are you&nbsp;done?</h2>
<p>Almost every story has acceptance criteria - a set of conditions when the story
is deemed completed. It’s very tempting to put technical exit criteria in the&nbsp;story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code passes system&nbsp;tests</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if we take a look at previous mistakes, we know that a user story must
be focused on the user to be successful. A user usually doesn’t care about
system tests, repository check-ins and releases. A user story is not done until
the user hits their&nbsp;goal.</p>
<p>So what we need here&nbsp;is:</p>
<h3 id="a-cross-functional-team">A cross-functional&nbsp;team</h3>
<p>Our team should have all the people required to go from the idea to code to
deployment to marketing to sales to measurements. Because, as we know,
hand-offs between teams account for up to 90% of the lead time. Also, it’s a
huge demotivator when you know that the customers will see the feature you just
developed in half a&nbsp;year.</p>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<p>Next, we need metrics to measure if we actually hit the goal. Everyone on the
team should be aligned along those metrics. Otherwise, the story just falls
apart to the traditional departmentalized “throwing stuff over the&nbsp;wall”.</p>
<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>
<p>Finally, we need shared ownership, when all the team is responsible for the
user story, or rather, for the successful outcome of the user&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a better example of the acceptance&nbsp;criterion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About us&#8221; page drop-off ratio is down at least&nbsp;30%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference is obvious. We have a crystal-clear metric, and regardless of
what technical approach we choose, we can always determine if we have
succeeded. Also, this prevents us from gold plating - perfecting the solution
because of some perceived &#8220;quality&#8221;&nbsp;issues.</p>
