<p>There&#8217;s no typo in the title. Our figures show that the lower website
conversion rate you have during seasonal peaks, the better it is for your sales. In
fact, by decreasing conversion, we managed to boost our sales. Read on to learn
how that&nbsp;works.</p>


<p>Everyone is obsessed with website conversion optimization nowadays. It&#8217;s
considered a major indicator of your web performance. Google has a whopping
59,300,000 results for those who want to improve their conversion&nbsp;rate.</p>
<p><img alt="Google has over 53M results for conversion improvement" src="./images/low-conversion-rate/google-conversion-results.png" /></p>
<p>Jayson DeMers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2016/10/24/50-ways-to-increase-your-websites-conversion-rate/):">writes on Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I had to pick only one metric, or one variable, that matters to the bottom
line of an online marketing campaign, it would be your conversion&nbsp;rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are even special holiday conversion optimization guides, like <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/heres-your-checklist-to-boosting-your-e-commerce-conversion-rate-this-holiday-season/">this excellent one</a> by Pratik&nbsp;Dholakiya.</p>
<p>So conversion rate is king, right? Not&nbsp;entirely.</p>
<h1 id="the-conversion-rate-delusion">The conversion rate&nbsp;delusion</h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what makes people convert more when you tune things on your website.
A variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> applies perfectly&nbsp;here:</p>
<ul>
<li>20% of resulting growth is because you&#8217;re removing friction. You fix obvious usability issues, helping the decided customers who experienced troubles with&nbsp;buying.</li>
<li>80% is persuasion of the undecided. That is, acquiring clients who were not initially going to make an order right&nbsp;away.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here lies the issue. The majority of conversion experiments drive
additional leads from the upper parts of the sales funnel. That means that
fewer prospective customers are going to buy anything from you, just because
they haven&#8217;t decided yet. And, probably, won&#8217;t decide&nbsp;ever.</p>
<p>Take a look at a SiriusDecisions Demand Waterfall&nbsp;model:</p>
<p><img alt="SiriusDecisions Demand Waterfall" src="./images/low-conversion-rate/sirius-model.jpg" /></p>
<p>The higher the degree of persuasion on your site, the smaller <span class="caps">MQL</span> (Marketing
Qualified Leads) proportion you will be&nbsp;having.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it. Larry Kim of Wordstream <a href="https://moz.com/blog/10-cro-truth-bombs-that-will-change-the-way-you-think">conducted research</a> on the
same matter. His results speak for themselves. As the website&#8217;s conversion rate
is going up, fewer and fewer prospective clients turn into&nbsp;buyers.</p>
<p><img alt="MQL and conversions ratio" src="./images/low-conversion-rate/mql-ratio-for-conversions.png" /></p>
<p>Brad Smith with Codeless put together <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/high-conversion-rate-might-backfire/">even more compelling evidence</a> that
thoughtless conversion rate optimization leads nowhere but towards a decline in&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem arises for seasonal businesses. While having low <span class="caps">MQL</span>
rate off-season may be a desired behavior, you would certainly not want to miss
the most engaged shoppers during the high&nbsp;season.</p>
<h1 id="real-life-story">Real-life&nbsp;story</h1>
<p>As a Top-10 Russian online travel agency, we have pronounced seasonal demand
fluctuations. Our product is complicated, and we employ a few dozens of experts
to help people make the right choice. In other words, our bottleneck is human&nbsp;interaction.</p>
<p>We had two&nbsp;goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the most revenue both during low and high&nbsp;seasons</li>
<li>Keep sales efficiency stable, dealing with demand spikes and&nbsp;downturns</li>
</ul>
<p>First, we identified three distinctive customer intents from the top to the bottom of a sales funnel. For us, they&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consideration: &#8220;A ballpark estimate of how much my tour would&nbsp;cost.&#8221;</li>
<li>Evaluation: &#8220;Select a particular hotel that fits my goals&nbsp;most.&#8221;</li>
<li>Purchase &#8220;Book a hotel, buy tickets,&nbsp;etc.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a 2x difference in lead count between the Consideration and Purchase
option. In other words, by adding a &#8220;Calculate my tour for me&#8221; option on the
website, the lead volume&nbsp;doubles.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, we experimented with different CTAs. We switched to the
top of the funnel during low season and rolled back to the bottom when demand&nbsp;grew.</p>
<p>So how does all that transform into revenue? Let&#8217;s take a look at our <span class="caps">CR</span> and
income for Q1-Q3&nbsp;2017:</p>
<p><img alt="Managed conversion ratio leads to rise in sales" src="./images/low-conversion-rate/conversion-sales-ratio.png" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not at liberty to give out specific revenue figures, but the trend is
apparent. By managing the conversion rate, we were able to make the most of
the low season at the same time not drowning in summer&#8217;s demand&nbsp;surge.</p>
<h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1>
<ol>
<li>Almost every business has seasonal spikes. Increase and decrease your conversion rate depending on the&nbsp;season.</li>
<li>Identify your buyers&#8217; intents along their customer journey. Create different a <span class="caps">CTA</span> for each&nbsp;one.</li>
<li>Make the above options easily switchable. For instance, it takes us about a 1 minute to switch the conversion rate option on our&nbsp;website.</li>
<li>When you feel you need more leads, upshift. When you&#8217;re overloaded, downshift. That applies to individual&nbsp;products.</li>
<li>Watch the sales. For every A/B test, think about how the feature affects the entire funnel, not only website&#8217;s <span class="caps">CR</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you had to lower website <span class="caps">CR</span> to make it sell more? Please share in&nbsp;comments!</p>
